> OPERATORS

* ARITCHMETIC OPERATORS
    ```
    x=8
    y=10
    x+y
    x-y
    x*y
    x/y
    ```
* ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
    ```
    x=2
    ```
    **SHORTHAND OPERATIOMS ALSO WORKS IN PYHTON:**

    ```
    x+=2
    ```
    Here, the command executed is actually x=x+2.
    ```
    x*=2
    ```
    Here, the command executed is actually x=x*2.
    Python also allows multiple variable assignment in single line.
    
    Example:
    ```
    a,b=2,3
    ```
    Here, a=2, b=3.

    < , > , == , <= , >= , != .
    ```
