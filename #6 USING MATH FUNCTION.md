### **USING MATH FUNCTION**

```
import math
```
For ease of coding, we can substitute math module with a custom name such as 'm':
```
import math as m
```
For using math functions we use the following code:
```
math.pow(3,2)
```
This function pow helps to find a value raised to a power.

For ease of typing using custom name 'm':
```
m.pow(3,2)
m.sqrt(4)
```
**Math function also has pre-defined constants like pi, epsilon.**
If we need to use just a few functions from math module instead of all the pre-defined functions, we use the following:
```
from math import sqrt,pow
```
To know all the available functions under **MATH** module

Use code: 
```
help('math')
```
